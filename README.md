## 🛒 Shopping Cart Game

Welcome to the **Shopping Cart Game**, a fun and psychologically intriguing browser-based challenge!

## 🎮 Game Description

In this game, your objective is to **click on vegetable images in the exact order listed** in the grocery list. But here's the twist:

- The **image and the name displayed together do not match**.
- You must ignore the misleading labels and identify vegetables by **photo only**, based on a separate name-only grocery list.

The result? A fascinating **clash between the left and right brain** that makes what seems like a simple task surprisingly difficult!

## 🧠 Psychology Behind the Game

This game is inspired by cognitive interference tasks like the **Stroop Effect**, where conflicting information slows down processing. Here's how the brain responds:

- 🧠 **Left Brain (Analytical)** tries to read and process the names.
- 🎨 **Right Brain (Visual)** tries to recognize the images.

When **words and visuals contradict**, your brain experiences **interference**, increasing the time and effort required to complete the task.

**Ironically**, a **child who cannot read yet** will likely perform better than an adult — they focus purely on visual cues without the distraction of conflicting text.

> ⚡️ If the task were only visual (images) or only verbal (names), players could complete it easily and well within the 20-second limit.
